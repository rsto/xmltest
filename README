Package xmltest provides utilities for XML testing.

I contributed this code to golang.org/x/net/webdav but found it might be
useful outside that package. Use it to compare if XML content is equal on
a semantic but not on byte level.

Note: The normalised XML output of this package is not equivalent to
Canonical XML.  If there is enough interest I might get into that.

This package requires a recent Go 1.5 release candidate.
